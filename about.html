      <p>
        If you're reading this — thank you. Whether I asked you to come here or you found it yourself, I'm genuinely glad you’re here.
      </p>

      <p>
        This website wasn’t built for fame, for likes, or to go viral. It was built for me — and anyone else like me.
        People trying to understand why they feel the way they do, why some connections feel electric while others feel like silence, why they care deeply in a world that’s emotionally shallow.
      </p>

      <p>
        We live in the Matrix. TikTok. Instagram reels. Porn. Dopamine’s everywhere. Fast content. Fast love. Fast goodbyes.  
        But attention? **Real attention?** That’s rare.  
        People don’t take the time to *know* anyone anymore. They swipe, get a hit of connection, and ghost when things get real.
      </p>

      <p>
        When your phone breaks, you try to fix it.  
        You don’t throw it away unless it’s truly outdated or useless.  
        So why don’t we treat relationships with the same patience?  
        When did it become easier to “move on” than to try?
      </p>

      <p>
        This project is my response to that mindset.  
        It took me 27 years to begin understanding myself — and I realized something:  
        **You can’t understand someone in a week, a month, or even a year.**  
        Understanding takes patience. Time. Repetition. Care. That’s what love is.
      </p>

      <p>
        I spent nights reflecting. Alone.  
        Looking in the mirror and replaying my life — decision by decision.  
        In that solitude, I discovered a book called <em>Attached</em>.  
        That book gave me language for things I’d always felt but couldn’t name.  
        I realized my reactions weren’t random — they were patterns. My attachment style explained a lot.
      </p>

      <p>
        I used to think only women created drama when they didn’t get attention in relationships.  
        Turns out — that’s not a gender thing.  
        That’s a **human response to emotional disconnection**. That’s protest behavior.  
        Or sometimes… it’s deactivation. Shutting down instead of leaning in.
      </p>

      <p>
        I’m still learning.  
        Some people don’t get it — they think once you’re married or committed, none of this theory matters.  
        But I disagree. Because theory turns into action. And action turns into habits. And habits build (or break) relationships.
      </p>

      <p>
        <strong>Realization is everything.</strong>  
        Loving someone isn’t just about chemistry or compatibility. It’s a decision. A discipline. A daily act of seeing, hearing, understanding — and staying.
      </p>

      <blockquote class="hero-quote">
        “My wife used to fart in her sleep.”<br />
        <span class="quote-source">— <em>Good Will Hunting</em></span><br />
        Might sound silly, but it’s one of the most profound moments in the film.  
        Sean wasn’t talking about romance — he was talking about *real*.  
        Real love lives in the mundane. In the quirks. In the little things you grow to adore.
      </blockquote>

      <blockquote class="hero-quote">
        “You’re just a kid. You don’t have the faintest idea what you’re talking about.”<br />
        <span class="quote-source">— <em>Good Will Hunting</em></span><br />
        It’s a reminder that reading about love isn’t the same as living it.  
        You can highlight every page in every book — but you won’t understand it until it’s your heart on the line.
      </blockquote>

      <blockquote class="hero-quote">
        “The past is just a story we tell ourselves.”<br />
        <span class="quote-source">— <em>Her (2013)</em></span><br />
        And maybe that’s the beauty of healing. You don’t erase the past — but you rewrite how it shapes you.
      </blockquote>

      <p style="margin-top: 2rem;">
        So yeah. This is more than a quiz. It’s a mirror.  
        I hope it gives you something — a pause, a “damn that’s me,” or maybe even a little closure.
