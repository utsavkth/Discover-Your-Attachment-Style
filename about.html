      <h2>The Personal Journey Behind This Project</h2>

      <p>
        Like many people, I’ve often found myself asking:
        <strong>“Why do I behave the way I do in relationships?”</strong>
        Why do I sometimes get too attached? Or pull away when things get real?
      </p>

      <p>
        My turning point came when I read <em>Attached</em> by Amir Levine and Rachel Heller. That book didn’t just explain my patterns — it gave me language for what I’d been feeling all along.
      </p>

      <p>
        That insight planted the seed for this project. I wanted to build something accessible, insightful, and even a little fun — something that helps you see yourself with compassion.
      </p>

      <p>
        This quiz isn’t about labeling or diagnosing. It’s about awareness — a mirror to reflect how you connect, how you love, and how your early emotional wiring might still shape your relationships today.
      </p>

      <p>
        My hope is that it empowers you the way it empowered me — to move toward healthier relationships, with others and with yourself.
      </p>

      <p>
        From one curious human to another: <br />
        <strong>Welcome to your emotional blueprint.</strong>
