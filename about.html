      <p>
        If you’re reading this — thank you. For real. Maybe I asked you to check it out. Or maybe you landed here on your own, curious. Either way, I’m glad you're here. And if you read it all the way through? I hope you let me know.
      </p>

      <p>
        Like any human being, I craved love. I longed for connection. I wanted that partner-in-crime type of love. The problem was, I attached quickly. Fell fast. And while friends shared stories of long-distance trust or live-in heartbreak, I was navigating a reality where <em>I gave trust freely</em> — and got betrayed twice.
      </p>

      <p>
        My partner had an avoidant attachment style. Always distant. Always on guard. And still, I stayed. I forgave her. I believed “everyone makes mistakes.” At the time, I thought I was securely attached. Turns out, that experience flipped something inside me. I became anxious. Overthinking. Second-guessing. Needing more than I ever used to.
      </p>

      <p>
        That’s when I started searching for answers. I dove into the 5 Love Languages. Then came the book <em>Attached</em> by Amir Levine and Rachel Heller. That book didn’t just help me understand her — it helped me understand <strong>me</strong>. Why I react. Why I over-care. Why I cling, why I withdraw.
      </p>

      <p>
        Oh, and — I have ADHD. That adds another layer. Rejection Sensitivity Dysphoria (RSD) is real. It’s why even the smallest emotional distance can feel like abandonment. Why I read between the lines even when there’s nothing written there. ADHD didn’t just shape my brain. It shaped my attachment too.
      </p>

      <p>
        This project was born out of all of that. Out of hurt. Growth. Reflection. Learning. I didn’t build this quiz for clicks or clout. I built it for people like me. For the version of me who once thought, “Why can’t I get the love I deserve?”
      </p>

      <p>
        In today’s world — fast, swipable, impatient — love feels like war. You're not just looking for connection anymore. You're fighting for someone’s attention. But real love? Real connection? That comes when you pause to <strong>understand</strong>. Yourself. Your patterns. Your partner.
      </p>

      <blockquote class="hero-quote">
        “In a world where separation often feels easier than connection, learning how we attach helps us see that love isn’t about finding someone new — it’s about showing up, understanding, and growing with the one we’re with.”
      </blockquote>
