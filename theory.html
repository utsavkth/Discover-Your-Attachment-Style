      <h2>Breaking Down Attachment Styles</h2>
      <p>
        Attachment theory explains how we connect with others — especially in close relationships. It all starts with the bond we formed with our caregivers as babies. That early blueprint quietly shapes how we love, trust, and react to emotional closeness.
      </p>

      <p>There are 4 primary attachment styles:</p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Secure</strong> – You’re comfortable with intimacy and independence. You communicate openly and trust easily.</li>
        <li><strong>Anxious</strong> – You crave closeness but often worry about being abandoned or not being “enough.”</li>
        <li><strong>Avoidant</strong> – You value independence, sometimes to the point of pushing others away or shutting down emotionally.</li>
        <li><strong>Fearful-Avoidant</strong> – A mix of anxious and avoidant. You want closeness but fear it too. Relationships feel like walking on a tightrope.</li>
      </ul>

      <h3>Why It Matters</h3>
      <p>
        Your attachment style can explain:
        <ul>
          <li>Why certain people trigger you</li>
          <li>Why you fall fast — or run the other way</li>
          <li>Why some relationships feel safe, while others feel like a storm</li>
        </ul>
      </p>

      <p>
        The best part? <strong>Your attachment style isn’t a life sentence.</strong> With awareness and effort, it can evolve.
      </p>

      <p>
        This quiz is just the starting point. You’ll get insight, reflection, and maybe even a few “aha” moments along the way.
